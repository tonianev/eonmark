//! The meeting point between Bevy and the simulation (M2, design decisions
//! 1-3): the `SimHandle` non-send resource, the `FixedUpdate` driver, the
//! `InputSource` trait with its three sources, `PendingCommands`, and the
//! replay recorder thread.
//!
//! One frame: `reset_frame_budget` (`PreUpdate`) zeroes the per-frame tick
//! counter; `step_sim` runs in `FixedUpdate` zero to [`MAX_TICKS_PER_FRAME`]
//! times (`Time<Virtual>::max_delta` is 250 ms, so at 20 Hz the schedule
//! never asks for more than 5; the cap guards a future higher rate). For
//! each due tick it asks the active [`InputSource`] for the commands issued
//! during that tick: `None` is a stall (no step, keep waiting), `Some(cmds)`
//! steps the sim, hands the batch to the recorder and, every
//! [`HashCadence::every`] ticks, a hash checkpoint. When the budget is spent
//! the remaining overstep is discarded and counted in [`DriverStats`].
//! `finish_recorder_on_exit` (Last) sees `AppExit` messages written earlier
//! in the frame, sends `Finish` and joins the writer thread with a bounded
//! wait, so Cmd-Q (through `macos_menu`), the close button and
//! `--exit-after-seconds` all leave a replay with the clean-exit trailer.
//!
//! The headless replay runner (`headless.rs`) reuses [`drive_tick`],
//! [`ReplayInput`] and [`ReplayFinished`] without the fixed clock or the
//! recorder; `frame_stats.rs` reads [`DriverStats::flushes_sent`] to
//! attribute frame-time spikes to the recorder flush.
