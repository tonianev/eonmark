//! Commands: the only input to the simulation.
//!
//! A command issued during tick `N` is applied at tick `N + cmd_delay` in
//! every mode (local, replay, future lockstep). Before application the
//! commands of a tick are sorted by `(player, seq)`, a total order, so the
//! order in which they arrived never matters.
