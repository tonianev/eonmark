//! Movement: arrival steering, spatial-grid separation, circle correction and
//! group-order target assignment. Specification: `docs/design/pathing.md`,
//! sections "Movement step", "Group orders: spiral offsets" and "BFS
//! nearest-passable fallback".
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of the hashed state passed in. The
//! [`SpatialGrid`] is derived: rebuilt every tick by `Sim::step` and by
//! `Sim::restore`, never hashed.
//!
//! Per tick, for every unit in `UnitId` order:
//!
//! 1. Arrival steering (units with a path) toward `order.path[order.next]`
//!    at `unit.speed` (tiles per tick), scaled down linearly inside the
//!    kind's `arrive_slowdown_radius` around the final waypoint. A waypoint
//!    is consumed when the unit is within the kind's `waypoint_radius` of
//!    it, or once the unit is closer to the following waypoint than the
//!    waypoint itself is; the final one when within the arrive radius,
//!    which clears the order, records the final waypoint's centre as the
//!    unit's [`Post`] and emits [`SimEvent::UnitArrived`].
//!    Return to post: an arrived unit (no order, a post) that has been
//!    pushed farther than the kind's `return_to_post_radius` from its post
//!    steers straight back to it with the same arrival steering, no path
//!    request, until it is within the arrive radius again (`Post::returning`
//!    carries the hysteresis across ticks). If terrain blocks the straight
//!    line the post becomes a `MoveOrder` and the unit requests a path like
//!    an ordinary move.
//! 2. Separation from neighbours read from the grid: for each neighbour
//!    closer than `radius_a + radius_b + separation`, accumulate a push-away
//!    vector of the penetration depth. Compare with `dist_sq_i64`, never a
//!    square root. The sum is capped at `speed / separation_push_moving_div`
//!    (an order, or returning to post) or `speed / separation_push_idle_div`
//!    (parked) so steering keeps the upper hand.
//! 3. Integrate: `pos += clamp(desired + separation, speed)`, sliding along
//!    a blocked tile's wall (x-only, then y-only) instead of entering it.
//! 4. After every unit has moved, circle-vs-circle correction over
//!    overlapping pairs in `(UnitId, UnitId)` order, half the penetration
//!    each; a correction that would enter a blocked tile is dropped.
//!
//! Units never enter a blocked tile. Repath triggers (each re-issues a
//! `PathRequest` through `Pathing::request`, unless one is still
//! outstanding): the next waypoint's tile is blocked, `tick >=
//! order.repath_at` (every `repath_interval_ds` while moving), or terrain
//! blocked every candidate step this tick. See [`step`] for the decisions
//! taken where the design is silent and the crowd measurements behind them.
//!
//! Every number here comes from `data/rules/`: the per-kind radii from
//! `units.ron` and the push caps and repath cadence from `rules.ron`.

///   and a step is never longer than the remaining distance, so a unit
///   cannot overshoot its waypoint.
/// - A non-final waypoint is consumed when the unit is within the kind's
///   `waypoint_radius` (half a tile) of it *or* is already closer to the
///   following waypoint than the waypoint itself is (the unit was pushed
///   past it; steering back would be a detour that stalls a crowd). This
///   second rule is what lets 500 units flow through the 8-tile water gap
///   at about one unit per tick.
/// - Separation pushes a unit away from each neighbour closer than
///   `radius_a + radius_b + separation` by the penetration depth along the
///   centre line; the sum is capped at `speed / separation_push_moving_div`
///   (2) for moving units and `speed / separation_push_idle_div` (8) for
///   units without an order, which also take part so a parked block yields
///   to a crowd instead of jamming it (an infinite divisor) or being flung
///   tiles away from where it arrived (a divisor of 2); measured on the
///   500-unit crossing, 8 keeps 95% of arrived units within 3 tiles of
///   their goal. Two coincident units push along the x axis, the higher id
///   eastward. Units later in id order see earlier units' updated positions.
/// - Return to post (`SIM_VERSION` 3) closes the remaining gap: a parked
///   unit pushed more than `return_to_post_radius_tiles_x100` (one tile)
///   from the centre it arrived at walks back with the normal arrival
///   steering and the moving push cap, and is parked again (idle cap) once
///   within the arrive radius. Posts of a group order are distinct spiral
///   tiles, so a block that has converged holds still: the 100-unit
///   convergence test asserts a constant hash over its last 100 ticks.
///   Two units that share one post (a spiral cut by the map edge pads with
///   the last target) jostle around it; that is the documented padding
///   case, not the normal one.
/// - A step that would enter a blocked tile (or leave the map) slides along
///   the wall (x-only, then y-only) and otherwise stays put.
/// - `facing` is the normalised velocity of the last tick the unit moved
///   (`v / |v|`, exact to one `I32F32` bit); it is untouched while standing
///   or while being pushed without an order.
/// - Circle correction is one pass over every unit (orders or not) in
///   `(a, b)` id order with `a < b`; coincident pairs separate along the x
///   axis. More passes were measured to slow the crowd, not help it.
