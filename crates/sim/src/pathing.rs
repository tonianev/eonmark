//! Budgeted, resumable in-house A* on the tile map, the per-tick request
//! queue and the transparent path cache. Specification:
//! `docs/design/pathing.md`.
//!
//! # What is hashed
//!
//! [`Pathing::queue`] and [`Pathing::active`] (the request being searched
//! and its full [`AStarSearch`]: open heap as a sequence, closed/g/parent
//! arrays, expansion counter) are hashed sim state and serialise with the
//! snapshot, so a snapshot taken mid-search restores the exact search.
//! `std::collections::BinaryHeap` serialises in internal array order and
//! deserialises by pushing in that order, which reproduces the identical
//! array; implementer A adds a test that a mid-search snapshot/restore is
//! byte-exact. [`Pathing::cache`] is derived, `#[serde(skip)]`, never hashed,
//! and cleared on every `cost_grid_generation` change and on restore.
//!
//! # Grid, costs, heuristic
//!
//! 8-connected; an orthogonal step costs [`COST_ORTHOGONAL`] (10) and a
//! diagonal [`COST_DIAGONAL`] (14). Neighbours come from
//! [`Map::neighbors8`], which already applies the no-corner-cutting rule.
//! The heuristic is [`octile`], admissible and consistent for these costs.
//!
//! # Open set order
//!
//! [`Node`]'s `Ord` is defined so that `BinaryHeap` (a max-heap) pops the
//! smallest `f` first, then the largest `g`, then the smallest tile index:
//! a total order, so every machine pops the same node. Stale entries (a tile
//! already closed) are skipped when popped and do not count as expansions.
//!
//! # Budget and `resume`
//!
//! [`AStarSearch::resume`] expands nodes until the goal is popped
//! (`Found`), the heap empties (`Exhausted`) or `*budget` reaches zero
//! (`Suspended`). It decrements `*budget` by the expansions it performed so
//! several searches share one per-tick budget
//! (`rules.path_budget_expansions`). Expansions, not pops, are charged.
//!
//! # Request queue
//!
//! Requests are kept sorted by `(requested_tick, UnitId)`. Each tick
//! [`Pathing::service`] walks the queue in that order: it corrects the goal
//! (blocked or in another component -> `Map::nearest_passable` within the
//! start's component), completes trivially when start == goal, then consults
//! the cache and finally runs or resumes the search. A `Suspended` result
//! ends the tick's pathing work; the request stays at the head as `active`.
//!
//! # The transparent cache rule (virtual budget)
//!
//! A cache entry stores the path *and* `expansions_used`, the total number of
//! expansions the original search spent. A hit must leave the hashed state at
//! the end of every tick identical to the state the same run reaches with the
//! cache disabled, so that `path_cache_is_transparent` can assert equal
//! hashes every tick. Therefore a hit is honoured only when
//! `expansions_used <= *budget` at the moment the request is reached: the
//! request then completes this tick with the cached path and `*budget` is
//! reduced by exactly `expansions_used`, which is precisely what the real
//! search would have done. When `expansions_used > *budget` the real search
//! would have suspended with a partially built heap in hashed state; no cache
//! replay can reproduce that, so the hit is ignored and a real search runs
//! (it suspends naturally and is cached when it completes). Timing, results
//! and hashes are thereby identical with the cache on or off; the cache only
//! saves work for searches that fit in the remaining budget.
//!
//! Cache key: `(start tile index, goal tile index, cost_grid_generation)`.
//! Eviction is deterministic: entries are stored in a `BTreeMap` keyed by an
//! insertion counter and the smallest counter is evicted at capacity. Whether
//! the cache evicts or hits never changes results, only work.
