//! The `.eonreplay` file format, its writer and reader, and `verify`.
//! Specification: `docs/DETERMINISM.md`, "Replays".
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! "EONR"                      4 magic bytes            (MAGIC)
//! u16 little-endian           format version, 1       (FORMAT_VERSION)
//! postcard(MatchSetup)        header
//! postcard(Record)*           stream, no framing
//! ```
//!
//! Records are [`Record::Tick`] for every tick that had commands (the
//! commands handed to `Sim::step` for that tick, before the command delay)
//! and [`Record::Hash`] after every `hash_every` ticks (20 by default, 1 under
//! `--hash-every-tick`) plus one final hash at clean exit. Records are
//! written in tick order; a tick's `Tick` record precedes its `Hash` record.
//!
//! The reader tolerates truncation (`kill -9`): it decodes records with
//! `postcard::take_from_bytes` and stops at the first record that does not
//! decode, keeping everything before it. Postcard encodings are
//! self-delimiting and prefix-free per type, so a cut-off tail never decodes
//! as a shorter valid record.
//!
//! # Writer
//!
//! [`ReplayWriter`] wraps a `BufWriter<File>`. `tick` and `hash` append
//! records; `flush` writes the buffer (the game calls it every 20 ticks);
//! `finish` flushes and `sync_all`s once at clean exit. No fsync during play
//! (Apple `F_FULLFSYNC` cost). The dedicated writer thread and channel live
//! in the game crate (M2); this type is the sink.
//!
//! # Verify
//!
//! [`verify`] reads the file, fails fast on `sim_version` mismatch, loads
//! the rules from `data_dir` and compares `rules_hash`, then re-simulates:
//! for each tick from 0, `step` with that tick's recorded commands (none
//! when no `Tick` record exists), and at every `Hash` record compares the
//! whole hash; on mismatch the first differing field of
//! [`SubHashes`] names the subsystem. The result is exactly one
//! [`VerifyOutcome`], whose `Display` is the string the CLI prints.
