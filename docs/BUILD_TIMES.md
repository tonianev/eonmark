# Build times

This document records measured build, test and CI wall times on the development Mac and on GitHub's hosted runners, so contributors know what to expect and so regressions are visible. The local rows were measured on 2026-10-05 during the M0 build; CI rows were filled from the first GitHub Actions runs on 2026-10-06 (cold caches); warm figures come from the first external PR (#17), whose jobs reused the cache written by the main run; later milestones append rows rather than overwrite. Numbers here are measurements, not gates, except where the design sets a budget (noted in the Notes column). The profile and feature setup that these numbers depend on is explained in [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Machine

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Chip | Apple M5 Max, 128 GB RAM |
| macOS | 27.0.1 |
| Xcode | 27 (Command Line Tools; default ld-prime linker) |
| Rust | 1.99.0 (from `rust-toolchain.toml`) |
| Linker overrides | none (`.cargo/config.toml` holds only `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`) |

## Local builds and tests

| Measurement | Date | Machine | Seconds | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cold `cargo build -p game --features dev` | 2026-10-05 | Apple M5 Max, macOS 27.0.1, Xcode 27, Rust 1.99.0 | 155 (2 min 34 s wall, 2173 s CPU) | Fresh `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `--timings`. Only public data point before this: about 5 min on a Ryzen 5600X. |
| Incremental after `touch crates/game/src/main.rs` (no content change) | 2026-10-05 | same | 0.56 | With `dev` (dynamic linking). |
| Incremental after a real source edit in `crates/game` | 2026-10-05 | same | 10.3 | With `dev`; dependencies warm. |
| `cargo build -p game --profile ci` | 2026-10-05 | same | 142 (2 min 22 s wall, 1731 s CPU) | The profile every CI Bevy compile uses. Near-cold: `target/ci` held only clippy metadata. |
| `cargo clippy -p game --features dev --all-targets` | 2026-10-05 | same | 18-20 (0.8 warm) | Dependencies already checked; the higher figure when `rules` needed re-checking. |
| `cargo test -p sim` | 2026-10-05 | same | 0.93 (0.15 warm) | After `touch crates/sim/src/lib.rs`, rebuild plus run, 14 tests. Budget: under 10 s for the non-ignored suite (sim at `opt-level = 3`). |
| `cargo test -p sim` (M1 suite: 57 lib tests, 6 M0 tests, 15 M1 tests: determinism, snapshot/restore, proptests at 32 cases, path oracle, return-to-post convergence, short goldens; 1 long golden ignored) | 2026-10-06 | same | 2.86 (rebuild plus run; 2.06 warm) | Budget: under 10 s. Measured with `/usr/bin/time -p cargo test -p sim` after a source touch; 78 tests run. |
| `cargo test -p rules` | 2026-10-05 | same | 0.01 run (about 5 compile, cold crate) | 15 tests. |
| `cargo clippy -p sim -p rules -p ai -p sim-cli --all-targets` | 2026-10-05 | same | 0.37 | Warm. |
| `cargo run -q -p sim-cli -- data-check data` | 2026-10-05 | same | 1.8 | Warm target dir, debug profile. |
| `cargo deny check` | 2026-10-05 | same | about 5 | Warm advisory database. |
| `cargo run -p game --profile ci -- --headless-run 200` | 2026-10-05 | same | 3.65 | Including cargo. Budget: under 10 s. M2 switched CI to the replay fixture row below. |
| `cargo run -p game --profile ci -- --headless-run crates/sim/tests/fixtures/move_500.eonreplay` (1200 ticks, 500 units; the CI hash-parity step since M2) | TBD (M2 integration) | same | TBD (M2 integration) | Budget: under 10 s (ROADMAP M2 acceptance). Measured by `scripts/m2_checks.sh` check 1 with `M2_CHECKS_CI_PROFILE=1` (`/usr/bin/time -p` on the built binary, so cargo is excluded); record the dev-build figure in Notes. |
| `cargo test -p game` (`tests/headless_replay.rs`: `move_500_short` through `SimPlugin` on `MinimalPlugins`, one tick per update) | TBD (M2 integration) | same | TBD (M2 integration) | Budget: a few seconds for the non-ignored test; the 1200-tick variant is `#[ignore]`. |
| `just ci`, everything warm | 2026-10-05 | same | 7.5 | All steps cached; the cost is the gates themselves, not compilation. |
| Windowed `dev` build, FPS overlay | 2026-10-05 | same | 89-120 fps | 1280x800 logical (Retina 2x), AutoVsync on a 120 Hz display. |
| Windowed `dev` build, `--scenario units200_auto` frame time (200 Yeomen crossing the map; `frame_stats:` lines printed on exit) | TBD (M2 integration) | same | mean TBD ms, p95 TBD ms, max TBD ms, dropped ticks TBD | Proxy for the ROADMAP M2 line "FPS >= 60, no periodic hitch at the 1 s replay flush": mean under 16.7 ms and p95 well under 33 ms with 0 dropped ticks. From `scripts/m2_checks.sh` check 6 (`--exit-after-seconds 65`, `--replay-dir` in the scratch dir). |

## CI job wall times

| Job | Runner | Date | Cold (s) | Warm (s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `check` | macos-26 (arm64, 3 cores, 7 GB) | 2026-10-06 | 2483 (41 min 23 s) | 126 (2 min 6 s) | Run 37395557940 (cold); warm figure from PR #17 run 37421181508 reusing main's rust-cache. A parallel cold run on the same day (Dependabot PR) took 1569 s (26 min 9 s): macOS runner time varies a lot under capacity constraints. Soft target under 25 min warm. |
| `headless` | ubuntu-24.04 | 2026-10-06 | 997 (16 min 37 s) | 74 | Includes the cold Bevy build for the 200-tick smoke; the engine-free tests alone finish in about a minute. Parallel PR run: 947 s. |
| `game-linux` | ubuntu-24.04 | 2026-10-06 | 240 (4 min 0 s) | 41 | Compile-only clippy. Parallel PR run: 256 s. |
| `release-check` | macos-26 | 2026-10-06 | 812 (13 min 32 s) | 345 (5 min 45 s) | Cold: run 37395557967. Warm: run 37464362381 on main (9f63e6c), rust-cache hit. Release profile plus `bundle.sh`, plutil, codesign verify. |
| `deny` | ubuntu-24.04 | 2026-10-06 | 54 | 46 | cargo-deny-action, advisory database fetch dominates. |
| `hash-parity` | ubuntu-24.04 | 2026-10-06 | 5 | 6 | Artifact download plus `diff`. Needs `check` and `headless`. |

## Audio backend at M0

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Is `coreaudio-sys` (bindgen) in the graph? | No. cpal 0.17.3 resolves through `coreaudio-rs` 0.14.2 (objc2 bindings, no bindgen). |
| Did the audio backend build against the Xcode 27 SDK? | Yes (2026-10-05). |
| Fallback used (`default-features = false` minus `bevy_audio` and `vorbis`)? | No. |

## Benchmarks

Append a row whenever a bench acceptance passes. Budgets come from the design.

| Bench | Milestone | Date | Mean (ms) | p95 (ms) | Budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `step_500_units` (500 movers crossing the map through all three fords, release; `sim-cli bench --units 500 --ticks 1200`) | M1 | 2026-10-06 | 0.511 | 0.861 | mean < 5, p95 < 10 | max 1.191 ms; `SIM_VERSION` 3, `rules_version` 3 (return to post). Arrival: 35.0% at tick 1200, 100% (500/500, 0 moving, 0 displaced) at tick 2400; >= 99% first held at tick 1624. Mean over 2400 ticks 0.350 ms, p95 0.837 ms. Earlier single-ford stream: 0.409 / 0.852 ms, 85.4% arrived at 1200 with 25 units displaced before return to post existed. |
| `astar_budget` (one saturated 4000-expansion A* tick, release; `sim-cli bench --astar --budget 4000`) | M1 | 2026-10-06 | 0.309 | 0.351 | < 2 | max 0.501 ms over 100 iterations toward a blocked goal (`expansions_used=4000 suspended=100`); earlier runs 0.244 / 0.336 and 0.276 / 0.372 ms. |
| `territory_recompute` (incremental) | M3a | TBD (M3a) | TBD (M3a) | | < 2 | |
| `step` with 200 vs 200 fighting | M4a | TBD (M4a) | TBD (M4a) | TBD (M4a) | mean < 5, p95 < 10 | |
| AI think time per tick | M5b | TBD (M5b) | TBD (M5b) | | < 0.5 | |
| Frame time, 400 units + two Towns + fog, 1440p release | M7 | TBD (M7) | | | >= 60 fps on a base M-series chip | Draw calls < 500 from the dev-panel counter |

## How to measure

Run from the repository root with the pinned toolchain on `PATH` (see the rustup note in [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

Cold build with a per-crate timeline. The HTML report lands in `target/cargo-timings/`.

```bash
cargo clean
/usr/bin/time -p cargo build -p game --features dev --timings
```

Incremental build after a trivial edit.

```bash
touch crates/game/src/main.rs
/usr/bin/time -p cargo build -p game --features dev
```

The CI profile.

```bash
/usr/bin/time -p cargo build -p game --profile ci
```

Sim tests.

```bash
/usr/bin/time -p cargo test -p sim
```

`/usr/bin/time -p` prints `real`, `user` and `sys` in seconds; record `real`. Use the absolute path so the shell builtin does not shadow it. For CI, read the job duration from the GitHub Actions run page; a cold run is one where the `rust-cache` step reports no cache hit.

Benches:

```bash
cargo bench -p sim
cargo run -p sim-cli --release -- bench --units 500 --ticks 1200
```

If a bench fails its budget, profile first (criterion on `sim`, or Bevy's `trace_tracy` feature on `game`) and change algorithms second. Flow fields are justified only by a failing `bench --units 500`.
