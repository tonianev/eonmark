# check_trademark.sh: enforce the naming rules from docs/NAME.md.

# The inspiration's title may appear only in README.md (one disclaimed
# sentence) and docs/design/prior-art.md (its Inspiration section and source
# citations). Spaced, underscored and hyphenated forms all count, so URLs and
# slugs are caught too. Its three-letter abbreviation and links to the
# inspiration's fan wiki may not appear anywhere.
# The check runs
# over the working tree (not the git index) so it works before the first
# commit and catches unstaged files. target/, dist/, .git/ and .claude/ (the
# agent harness keeps its worktrees there) are skipped.
#
# Usage: scripts/check_trademark.sh [repo-root]
# Exit 0 when clean; exit 1 and print the offending lines otherwise.
